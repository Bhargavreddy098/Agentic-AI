# Tool runtime and sandbox troubleshooting

| Symptom | Inspect | Safe response |
|---|---|---|
| Denied request | Principal, workspace and current policy | Correct scope; never disable enforcement |
| Pending indefinitely | Actual lifecycle, approval and dependency readiness | Show blocker; cancel explicitly if requested |
| Inconsistent output | Operation identity, revision and receipt | Reconcile before retry |
| Consumer stale | Durable query and event cursor | Refresh projection without repeating effect |
| Unavailable feature | Qualification and configuration | Report unavailable; never manufacture success |

Domain-specific invariant: Project commands use the qualified Docker Desktop/WSL2 trusted-local profile. WSL2 is the substrate, not authorization for arbitrary host or distro commands. Enforce bounded filesystem export/mount policy, network rules, resource limits and process cleanup. Timeout is not a sandbox.

Reproduce this scenario for diagnosis: Docker outage never selects host fallback; verify network/resource bounds, timeout cleanup and actual receipt.

Use correlation IDs and redacted logs. Never request API keys in chat or export secret-bearing database rows. When effect outcome is uncertain, preserve evidence and request an exact recovery decision if read-only reconciliation cannot resolve it.
