# Routing and budgets connections

## Peers

[providers](../providers/index.md), [approvals](../approvals/index.md).

## End-to-end handoff

1. UI/CLI or authorized internal trigger submits a scoped request.
2. Gateway/native boundary validates identity and decodes the contract.
3. Domain owner applies: Before inference reserve a bounded budget against eligible routes. Settle reported usage once using durable operation identity. Unreported usage is unknown, not zero. Failed or cancelled requests reconcile reservation state. Fallback must satisfy capabilities and remaining authority.
4. Consult direct dependency readiness and current action policy.
5. Execute only permitted work through the qualified boundary.
6. Persist actual outcome and stable receipt/event identifiers.
7. Render the result in the initiating consumer; reconnect queries durable state rather than reissuing mutations.

## Cross-domain failure behavior

A failed prerequisite produces explicit blocked/unavailable status. A duplicate event consults operation identity. Cancellation stops new dispatch and propagates abort; uncertain completion is reconciled before retry. Notification or rendering failures do not justify rerunning business effects.

## Integration scenario

Race two reservations, cancel an active request and repeat settlement; no double debit or unauthorized spend. Follow the [system journeys](../journeys/index.md); verify consumer state agrees with authoritative state. Never treat client API wrappers as proof of completed UI integration.
