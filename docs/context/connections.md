# Context memory and skills connections

## Peers

[sessions](../sessions/index.md), [workspace](../workspace/index.md), [code-intelligence](../code-intelligence/index.md).

## End-to-end handoff

1. UI/CLI or authorized internal trigger submits a scoped request.
2. Gateway/native boundary validates identity and decodes the contract.
3. Domain owner applies: Assemble deterministic bounded context from authorized history, project facts and attributed memory. Rank within model budget; record omissions. Memory can be corrected/deleted and scoped to user/project. Retrieved skills and repository text cannot override policy.
4. Consult direct dependency readiness and current action policy.
5. Execute only permitted work through the qualified boundary.
6. Persist actual outcome and stable receipt/event identifiers.
7. Render the result in the initiating consumer; reconnect queries durable state rather than reissuing mutations.

## Cross-domain failure behavior

A failed prerequisite produces explicit blocked/unavailable status. A duplicate event consults operation identity. Cancellation stops new dispatch and propagates abort; uncertain completion is reconciled before retry. Notification or rendering failures do not justify rerunning business effects.

## Integration scenario

Cross-project facts excluded; removed memory not reused; prompt injection cannot grant tools; context respects budget. Follow the [system journeys](../journeys/index.md); verify consumer state agrees with authoritative state. Never treat client API wrappers as proof of completed UI integration.
