# Intent research and requirements — research provenance

## How it works

Capture goals, constraints and non-goals; ask only consequential unresolved questions. Record research source, retrieval time and confidence separately from user instructions. Turn claims into measurable requirements with stable IDs. External content never grants permissions.

## Integration

[providers](../providers/index.md), [sessions](../sessions/index.md). The operation uses the same canonical owner whether initiated by UI, CLI or an authorized automation. Transport handlers decode and authorize; they do not establish a competing business state machine.

## Failure and restart

Persist identifiers and outcomes needed to distinguish no effect, completed effect and uncertainty. Retry only the documented idempotent case. If revision, target or authority changed, obtain a new decision before acting. Clean up bounded resources without deleting unrelated user state.

## Acceptance

Ambiguous scope triggers clarification; conflicting sources remain explicit; requirement revisions survive restart.

Implement and verify this mechanism through [contracts](contracts.md), [implementation](implementation.md) and [verification](verification.md). Exact wire/schema decisions require the contract task; all runtime evidence is currently NOT RUN.
