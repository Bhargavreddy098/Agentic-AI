# Deployment and integrations troubleshooting

| Symptom | Inspect | Safe response |
|---|---|---|
| Denied request | Principal, workspace and current policy | Correct scope; never disable enforcement |
| Pending indefinitely | Actual lifecycle, approval and dependency readiness | Show blocker; cancel explicitly if requested |
| Inconsistent output | Operation identity, revision and receipt | Reconcile before retry |
| Consumer stale | Durable query and event cursor | Refresh projection without repeating effect |
| Unavailable feature | Qualification and configuration | Report unavailable; never manufacture success |

Domain-specific invariant: Preview pins artifact, environment, target and rollback strategy. Separate approval authorizes deployment. Record real external release identity and measured health; reconcile uncertain outcome before retry. Target selection is a prerequisite, not an arbitrary adapter choice.

Reproduce this scenario for diagnosis: Changed artifact invalidates approval; real health probes required; failed deployment follows tested target rollback.

Use correlation IDs and redacted logs. Never request API keys in chat or export secret-bearing database rows. When effect outcome is uncertain, preserve evidence and request an exact recovery decision if read-only reconciliation cannot resolve it.
