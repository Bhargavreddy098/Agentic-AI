# Model providers — streaming and cancellation

## How it works

Adapters preserve exact model identifiers and normalize text, tools, usage and terminal outcomes. Abort flows from user request through coordinator to upstream. Partial output is stored as interrupted; a new provider cannot silently replay already executed effects.

## Integration

[security](../security/index.md), [routing](../routing/index.md), [sessions](../sessions/index.md). The operation uses the same canonical owner whether initiated by UI, CLI or an authorized automation. Transport handlers decode and authorize; they do not establish a competing business state machine.

## Failure and restart

Persist identifiers and outcomes needed to distinguish no effect, completed effect and uncertainty. Retry only the documented idempotent case. If revision, target or authority changed, obtain a new decision before acting. Clean up bounded resources without deleting unrelated user state.

## Acceptance

Real authorized model response; 401/429/timeout/stream truncation controls; cancellation releases lease.

Implement and verify this mechanism through [contracts](contracts.md), [implementation](implementation.md) and [verification](verification.md). Exact wire/schema decisions require the contract task; all runtime evidence is currently NOT RUN.
