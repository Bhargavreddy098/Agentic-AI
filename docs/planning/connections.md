# Planning and Build Contracts connections

## Peers

[requirements](../requirements/index.md), [approvals](../approvals/index.md).

## End-to-end handoff

1. UI/CLI or authorized internal trigger submits a scoped request.
2. Gateway/native boundary validates identity and decodes the contract.
3. Domain owner applies: A Build Contract pins requirement revision, plan DAG, workspace, effects, budgets and acceptance criteria. Approval attaches to its digest/revision. New scope produces a new revision; old approval cannot authorize it. Reject dependency cycles before run admission.
4. Consult direct dependency readiness and current action policy.
5. Execute only permitted work through the qualified boundary.
6. Persist actual outcome and stable receipt/event identifiers.
7. Render the result in the initiating consumer; reconnect queries durable state rather than reissuing mutations.

## Cross-domain failure behavior

A failed prerequisite produces explicit blocked/unavailable status. A duplicate event consults operation identity. Cancellation stops new dispatch and propagates abort; uncertain completion is reconciled before retry. Notification or rendering failures do not justify rerunning business effects.

## Integration scenario

Modify an approved plan and confirm new approval is required; Plan Only never dispatches a file write. Follow the [system journeys](../journeys/index.md); verify consumer state agrees with authoritative state. Never treat client API wrappers as proof of completed UI integration.
