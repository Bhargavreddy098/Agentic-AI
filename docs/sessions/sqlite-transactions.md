# Sessions and persistence — sqlite transactions

## How it works

One SQLite owner serializes writes. Never swallow BEGIN or COMMIT failure. Async callbacks may not interleave inside another request transaction. Tests set an isolated root before importing persistence. Attached databases remain current-source history, not the desired architecture.

## Integration

[security](../security/index.md). The operation uses the same canonical owner whether initiated by UI, CLI or an authorized automation. Transport handlers decode and authorize; they do not establish a competing business state machine.

## Failure and restart

Persist identifiers and outcomes needed to distinguish no effect, completed effect and uncertainty. Retry only the documented idempotent case. If revision, target or authority changed, obtain a new decision before acting. Clean up bounded resources without deleting unrelated user state.

## Acceptance

Concurrent writes, rollback, disk-full and process death never yield false committed success.

Implement and verify this mechanism through [contracts](contracts.md), [implementation](implementation.md) and [verification](verification.md). Exact wire/schema decisions require the contract task; all runtime evidence is currently NOT RUN.
