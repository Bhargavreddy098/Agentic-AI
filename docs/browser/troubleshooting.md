# Browser and computer runtime troubleshooting

| Symptom | Inspect | Safe response |
|---|---|---|
| Denied request | Principal, workspace and current policy | Correct scope; never disable enforcement |
| Pending indefinitely | Actual lifecycle, approval and dependency readiness | Show blocker; cancel explicitly if requested |
| Inconsistent output | Operation identity, revision and receipt | Reconcile before retry |
| Consumer stale | Durable query and event cursor | Refresh projection without repeating effect |
| Unavailable feature | Qualification and configuration | Report unavailable; never manufacture success |

Domain-specific invariant: Create bounded isolated browser profiles; navigation/read versus upload/download/account changes have different permissions. Page content is untrusted. Actual browser observations produce evidence; absence of adapter returns unavailable. Computer control needs separate narrow targeting.

Reproduce this scenario for diagnosis: Unconfigured browser cannot claim success; denied sensitive action causes no effect; profile and child resources cleaned.

Use correlation IDs and redacted logs. Never request API keys in chat or export secret-bearing database rows. When effect outcome is uncertain, preserve evidence and request an exact recovery decision if read-only reconciliation cannot resolve it.
