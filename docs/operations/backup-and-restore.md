# Release backup and recovery — backup and restore

## How it works

A qualified backup is consistent and integrity checked; restore is rehearsed into an isolated destination. Single-file conversion preserves originals. Updates retain compatible recovery paths; after new target writes, rollback cannot simply point at stale old data.

## Integration

[sessions](../sessions/index.md), [desktop](../desktop/index.md). The operation uses the same canonical owner whether initiated by UI, CLI or an authorized automation. Transport handlers decode and authorize; they do not establish a competing business state machine.

## Failure and restart

Persist identifiers and outcomes needed to distinguish no effect, completed effect and uncertainty. Retry only the documented idempotent case. If revision, target or authority changed, obtain a new decision before acting. Clean up bounded resources without deleting unrelated user state.

## Acceptance

Restore actual backup into fresh fixture; corrupt backup refused; restored application state matches invariants.

Implement and verify this mechanism through [contracts](contracts.md), [implementation](implementation.md) and [verification](verification.md). Exact wire/schema decisions require the contract task; all runtime evidence is currently NOT RUN.
